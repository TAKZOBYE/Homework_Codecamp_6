    <p style="font-family: Courier New">HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.</p>
    <p style="Times New Roman">
        It is the core
        language of the world wide web and is used to define 
        the structure and layout of web documents by using 
        various tags and attributes.
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">
        Although a fundamental language of the web, HTML is a 
        static language - content created with it does not change.
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: Georgia;">
        HTML is used to specify the way webpages look, not how they 
        function.
